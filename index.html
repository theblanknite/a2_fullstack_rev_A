<h4>What does <a href="images/full.png">"Full"</a> in full stack mean?</h4>
<p class="description">
	Full means that you are a full programmer, meaning that you can program on the client (user computer) end, and
	the server computer. The client computer is often referred to as the front end, and the server computer is
	referred to as the back end, so full means you can program in both the front and back end. 	
</p>

<h4>What does <a href="images/stack.png">"Stack"</a> in full stack mean?</h4>
<p class="description">
	The stack in full stack refers to the stack of programming languages that full programmers need to be familiar with.
	This includes front end programming languages such as HTML, CSS, Javascript and more, as well as back end languages
	such as PHP and mySQL. To be a full stack programmer, you will need to know these stacks of programs in order to 
	develop both the front and back end.

<h4>What does 
	<a href="images/drawing2.png">LAMP Stack</a> mean?
	</h4>
<p class="description">LAMP stands for:<br>
L: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a><br>
A: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_HTTP_Server">Apache</a>, which is our web server<br>
M: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL">MySQL</a>, the database we use<br>
P: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP">PHP</a>, which is the programming language we use on the server side	
</p>	

<h4>What is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">DB</a>?</h4>
<p class="description">
DB, or database, is an organized way to save data on a server. Databases of course are the lifeblood of all modern
business, because they can be used for things like tracking employees, orders, customers, payrole, and many other
important business related things. 	
</p>

<h4>What is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL">MySQL</a>?</h4>
<p class="description">
MySQL is a widely used database. It is not the most common database, but still very commonly used under
oracle. MySQL is FREE! The inventor of mySQL named this after his first daughter, and her name was "MY".
This inventor later created MariaDB, after his second daughter, "Maria". Therefore MySQL is "My" + 
structured language query.	
</p>

<h4>What is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">SQL</a>?</h4>
<p class="description">
SQL is a international standard language. It stands for structured Query Language. MySQL is the name of the database,
while SQL is the language you use inside of that database to answer questions. SQL is used for many mainstream
databases such as mySQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL.	
</p>

<h4>What is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP">PHP</a>?</h4>
<p class="description">
PHP is the programming language that connects front end to back end. It reads HTML forms and send info to a server. It
also reads the database and sends that back to another HTML form. PHP is server side, and totally secure and private.
PHP is the main back end language that makes communication between users and servers possible, and therefore makes
eCommerce and eBusiness possible.	
</p>

<h4>What is <a href="">MySQL from the CLI</a> (Command Line Interface)?</h4>
<p class="description">
The User Interface for DB's are HTML pages that WE Create!
The CLI is where experts where the Power Users can see inside of the DB
but in a very primitive, non-GUI way. In other words, CLI os fpr the DB experts,
not the users.

<ul>
<li>$ mysql -u root -p</li>
<li>Enter Password: </li>
<li>mysql> show databases;</li>	
<li>mysql> CREATE DATABASE a2_nugent_16may;</li>
<li>mysql> show databases;</li>
<li>
You're results should look like this:
<pre>
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| a2_nugent_16may    |
| mysql              |
| performance_schema |
| sys                |

</li>
<li>mysql> USE a2_nugent_16may;</li>	
</ul>
<ul><pre>
